    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This throwback recipe for tofu stir-fry with peanut sauce is from years
      ago when I was a hardcore vegan. Years later, it's still one of my
      staples. It's healthy, filling, and full of flavor!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (14 ounce) can light coconut milk</li>
      <li>1/4 cup peanut butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon lime juice</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Sriracha sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground chili pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>2 carrots, diced</li>
      <li>1 red bell pepper, diced</li>
      <li>1 (14 ounce) package firm tofu, drained and cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
      <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh garlic</li>
      <li>4 cups baby spinach</li>
      <l1>1-1/2 cups cooked brown rice</l1>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk coconut milk, peanut butter, soy sauce, brown sugar, lime juice,
        Sriracha sauce, and ground chili pepper together in a bowl until a
        smooth sauce forms.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add carrots and bell
        pepper; sauté until just tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Add tofu and sauté
        until lightly browned, about 4 minutes per side. Add garlic and ginger;
        cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour sauce into the skillet and stir to coat tofu and vegetables. Cook
        until flavors combine, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, then
        stir in spinach, 1 cup at a time, until wilted. Serve over brown rice.
      </li>
